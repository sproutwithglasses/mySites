    <h4>Headphones</h4>
    <p>Refurbished. I put a protective cover over the earcups because they keep clacking against each other and I hate the sound.</p>
    <!--Play music snippet from shuffled playlist when in focus.-->
 
    <h4>Glasses</h4>
    <p> Sometimes I take them off if I don't want to look at people.</p>
 
    <h4>Wallet</h4>
    <p>Broke.</p>
    <!--Inside the wallet-->
        <h4>Metro Card</h4>
        <p>I hate taking trains.</p>

        <h4>Parsons ID card</h4>
        <p>School ID card. Expired now.</p>

        <h4>Gatcha Card</h4>
        <p>This was an overpriced experience.</p>

        <h4>20$</h4>
        <p>For coffee maybe.</p>

        <h4>Credit and Debit Card</h4><!--Blurred-->
        <p>You wish. Click off</p>

        <h4>License</h4><!--Blurred-->
        <p>It was 80$ to renew this thing.</p>

    <!--Inside the wallet-->

    <h4>Hard Drive</h4>
    <p>Every graphic designers soul is stored in one of these.</p>

    <h4>Aquaphor</h4>
    <p>For dry spots and my chronic lip biting.</p>

    <h4>Perfume</h4>
    <p>Rose scented and oil based so it lasts longer.</p>

    <h4>House Keys</h4><!--Blurred or fake the teeth-->
    <p>I need to get into my home somehow.</p>

    <h4>Mint, Candy, Gum</h4>
    <p>For taste.</p>

    <h4>Pens</h4>
    <p>To write. 0.5 pens are prefered. Sometimes I bring a pocket book with me but I left it at home.</p>

    <h4>Laptop</h4>
    <p>*click* *click*.</p>

    <h4>Lemon Juice</h4>
    <p>Guilty pleasure. Mood booster.</p>

    <h4>Duck Keychain</h4>
    <p>My mom got me this.</p>

    <h4>Mouse</h4>
    <p>For my laptop.</p>

    <h4>Cat Pic Keychain</h4>
    <p>I love my tailess cat.</p>

    <h4>Sprout Hair Clip</h4>
    <p>Pikman Core.</p>

    <h4>Phone.</h4>
    <p>I don't really have friends. I listen to music and watch my inbox flood. I also text my mom a lot. <i>kidding</i>.</p>

    <h4>Puzzle Cube</h4>
    <p>You already know what this is.</p>

    <h4>Lint Roller</h4>
    <p>I have a cat and I wear black.</p>

    <h4>Lighter</h4>
    <p>I don't smoke. I use this for seals and broken ends.</p>

    <h4>Face Powder</h4>
    <p>Not too heavy, very natural looking and clean ingredients to avoid clogged pores.</p>

    <h4>Current Read: <i>Women Who Run With The Wolves: Myth and Stories of the Wild Woman Archetype</i> by Clarissa Pinkola Est√©s.</h4>
    <p>I think this book is really good for women in their early 20s ( or any age ). Might not be your cup of tea but it's nice to give it a try. Massages your soul as you read and moisturizes you after putting the book down.</p>
